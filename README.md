# City Defense Game
---
A city building game mixed with a tower defense.


## Created using C++ and SDL

SDL is used for the image rendering and screen building functions. SDL is similar to OpenGL, but much more limited in its graphics. Its only use in this project is displaying graphics to a window, and getting input via keyboard & mouse.
